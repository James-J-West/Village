DURAK SIMULATOR

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO HAVE NO CARDS IN YOUR HAND

SETUP:
    A FULL DECK OF 14 CARDS OF EACH SUIT (1 to 14)
    A TRUMP CARD IS CHOSEN WHERE THE SUIT OF THAT CARD IS THE TRUMP SUIT FOR THE GAME AND THE CARD IS PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK
    START WITH 5 PLAYERS EACH WITH 6 CARDS

ON A TURN:
    PLAYER ATTACKS THE NEXT PLAYER IN ORDER BY PLAYING A CARD OR SET OF CARDS WITH THE SAME VALUE
    OTHER PLAYERS EXCEPT THE DEFENDING PLAYER CAN CONSOLIDATE THE ATTACK BY ADDING A CARD WITH THE SAME VALUE AS A ACTIVE CARD TO THE ATTACKING POOL
    THEN THE DEFENING PLAYER HAS TO DEFEND THE ATTACKING POOL OF CARDS (THE INITIAL ATTACK + CONSOLIDATION)
    TO DEFEND AN ATTACK THE DEFENDING PLAYER HAS TO PLAY A CARD OF THE SAME SUIT BUT HIGHER VALUE
    A DEFENSE CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH A TRUMP - IF THE ATTACKING CARD IS NOT A TRUMP THE DEFENDER CAN DEFEND IT WITH ANY TRUMP
    IF THE ATTACKING CARD IS A TRUMP THE DEFENDING CARD MUST BE A HIGHER TRUMP

    ONCE ALL ACTIONS ARE TAKEN, EACH PLAYER DRAWS CARD BACK UP TO 6 IF THERE IS A DECK LEFT

A GAME ENDS WHEN THERE IS JUST ONE PLAYER LEFT WITH CARDS (THEY ARE THE LOSER)
